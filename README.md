# ConflictBasedSearch

For the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF), ConflictBasedSearch algorithm is proposed by Guni Sharon et al. 
[Conflict-based search for optimal multi-agent pathfinding](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/guni/Papers/CBS-AIJ15.pdf)

## LowLevelSearch

For the low level search, any single agent path finding algorithm can be used. We used 
[A* search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/) algorithm.

## Running tests and simulation

For testing and simulation, we are planning to add an UI with the visualization of the algorithm. For now, go the main.cpp and change the
map.txt file with existing test maps under data folder.
